<h3> First year graduate student at Indiana University of PA studying <u> Literature and Composition </u>
<p>After completing my Master's degree in Literature and Comp I hope to travel and teach internationally. I have always wanted 
 to explore and experience different people and places, as well as their culture. Ideally, with my exploration of the world and teaching
 I will have conducted research to use towards my dissertation. </p>
