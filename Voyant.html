<h1> Voyant Text Analysis of Charles Bukowski.</h1>
<h3> Charles Bukowski has been one of my favorite authors and poets since I first read him in high school. My junior English teacher told me to read his novel <I>Pulp</I>. However, I was unable to find a <I>Pulp</I> in a text that would allow me to copy and paste into Voyant for text analysis and so I picked three short stories that I had never read before. 
<ul><li> The Most Beautiful <a href ="http://www.mmryan.net/archive/writing/bukowskicharles/shortstories.html#mostbeautifulwoman">Woman</a>
<li>Trouble with a <a href="http://www.mmryan.net/archive/writing/bukowskicharles/shortstories.html#troublewithabattery"> Battery</a> 
<li> All The Great <a href="http://www.mmryan.net/archive/writing/bukowskicharles/shortstories.html#allthegreatwriters"> Writers</a>
</ul>
If I'm being honest, one of the biggest reasons why I like Charles Bukowski and why I wanted to use Voyant for text analysis is his vulgarity and perspective of the world. With that being said, I wanted to use Voyant as a tool to examine more close the contexts of such vulgarity. Also, if one has heard of Bukowski, it is unlikely that they were unaware of his vulgarity regards to life, love, sex, and women. A self-proclaimed '<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Dirty-Old-Charles-Bukowski/dp/0872860744">dirty </a> old man' I was most interested into looking at the more ... taboo aspects of Bukowski's writing because it is prominent in a majority of his works. 
<p>
And so, I immediately wanted to look a trends regarding both the frequency of the words women, as well as vulgarities.

In regards to frequency of gender, I inserted both 'men' and 'women' into the research trends attribute to see which was more frequent. Not surprisingly 'men' is more prominent by a long-shot - as seen above - than women, and when women are referenced it is usually in the context of sex in whihc most portrayals of women in Bukowski's work are prostitutes. 
<p>
 </p>
Before using the context tool in Voyant, I looked at the cirrus cloud where words like 'fuck', 'cock', and 'man' were seen, having a higher frquency in the texts than words like 'brother', 'eyes', or 'God'.  This proves that even in short stories that I had never read, Bukowski is consistent within himself.

<sp>
 <p>
 </p>
Then, finally using Voyant's context tools I inserted the words 'she', 'women', and 'fuck' for contextual analysis and one thing that I noticed is that in the short story <I>All The Great Writers</I> when I looked at the context of the word 'she', 'she' was frequently crazy whether it be mentally unstable or in regards to being a 'sex machine', women are portrayed as unstable and are highly sexualized.

<sp>
<p>
 </p>
And yet, there are stories unable to be analyzed due to copyright and copy and paste laws in which Bukowski writes wonderous poems about love and pain. His rawness in regards to life is something that sets him apart as a writer in my opinion, despite his highly sexualized view of women as prostitutes - I cannot help but wonder if he saw women that way because he had endured love, or if he struggled with enduring love because he saw women that way.
